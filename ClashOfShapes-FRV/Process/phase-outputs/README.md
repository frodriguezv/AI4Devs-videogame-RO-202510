# Phase Output Documentation

This folder contains detailed output documentation for each phase of the Shape Shifter game development.

## Purpose
Each phase output file provides comprehensive documentation of:
- What was implemented
- How it was implemented
- Code highlights and explanations
- Visual results
- Testing performed
- Issues encountered and resolved
- Learnings and insights

## File Naming Convention
- **Format**: `phase-XX-output.md`
- **Examples**:
  - `phase-01-output.md` (Phase 1: Core Setup & Game Loop)
  - `phase-02-output.md` (Phase 2: Player Entity & Basic Movement)
  - `phase-13-output.md` (Phase 13: Testing & Bug Fixes)

## When to Create
- **After completing each phase**
- Before moving to the next phase
- As part of the phase completion process

## What to Include
See `Rules/documentation-rules.md` for complete requirements.

### Minimum Required Sections:
1. Phase Overview (number, name, date, status)
2. What Was Implemented (classes, systems, features)
3. Code Highlights (key snippets with explanations)
4. Visual Results (screenshots or descriptions)
5. Testing Results (what passed, what failed)
6. Issues and Resolutions (bugs and fixes)
7. Learnings (insights gained)
8. Next Phase Considerations (technical debt, recommendations)

## Template
Refer to `Rules/documentation-rules.md` for the complete phase output template.

- [ ] `phase-09-output.md` - Camera System

### Polish Phases (10-11)
- [ ] `phase-10-output.md` - UI/HUD
- [ ] `phase-11-output.md` - Visual Effects & Polish

### Completion Phases (12-13)
- [ ] `phase-12-output.md` - Hazards & Game Over Logic
- [ ] `phase-13-output.md` - Testing & Bug Fixes

## How to Use These Files

### For Current Development
- Reference previous phases when building dependent features
- Understand implementation decisions
- Learn from past challenges

### For Debugging
- Find where a feature was implemented
- Understand why code was written a certain way
- Check what testing was performed

### For Documentation
- Provide detailed project history
- Show progress to stakeholders
- Create final project report

### For Future Projects
- Learn from this project's approach
- Avoid repeating mistakes
- Replicate successful patterns

## Quality Standards
All phase output files must:
- ✅ Follow the template structure
- ✅ Include all required sections
- ✅ Contain specific, detailed information
- ✅ Include relevant code snippets
- ✅ Document test results
- ✅ Be written clearly and professionally

## Relationship to Process.md
- **Process.md**: High-level summary of each phase (brief)
- **Phase output files**: Detailed documentation of each phase (comprehensive)

Both are required and serve different purposes.

---

**Note**: This folder should contain exactly 13 files when the project is complete (one for each phase).

**Last Updated**: [Date when last phase output was added]
